# Prodigy_ML_01
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
#Overview
This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical housing data, and predictions are made on a separate test dataset.

#Files Included
train.csv: CSV file containing the training dataset with features and target variable.
test.csv: CSV file containing the test dataset for making predictions.
linear_regression_house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:



git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook
Open linear_regression_house_price_prediction.ipynb and execute the cells to reproduce the results.
Description
Data Cleaning: Missing values in the features (GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, HalfBath) are handled using mean imputation.
Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained using the cleaned training dataset.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a validation set using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. Cross-validation is also performed to assess generalization.
Prediction: Predictions are made on the test dataset (test.csv) and saved to test_predictions.csv.
Results
Validation MSE: <value>
Validation R-squared: <value>
Cross-Validation R-squared: <value>
Future Improvements
